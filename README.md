This work introduces the design and development of smart green environment of garbage
monitoring system by measuring the garbage level in real time and to alert the municipality
where never the bin is full based on the types of garbage. The proposed system consisted the
ultrasonic sensors which measure the garbage level, an ARM microcontroller which controls
system operation whereas everything will be connected. This work demonstrates a system that
allows the waste management to monitor based on the level of the garbage depth inside the
dustbin. The system shows the status of different types of garbage; domestic waste, paper,
glass and plastic through in a real time to store the data for future use and analysis, such as
prediction of peak level of garbage bin fullness. It is expected that this system can create greener environment by monitoring and controlling the collection of garbage smartly through
IoT.
